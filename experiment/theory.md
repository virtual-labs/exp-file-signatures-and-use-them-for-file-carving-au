 <p>Most of the files we encounter on our computers have unique file signatures. These signatures are sequences of bytes located at the beginning of a file, known as the header, and they are important in identifying a file type. Utilizing the file signature of a JPG image, for example, allows for the extraction of JPG images from various sources such as traffic dumps, disk images, and other storage mediums. This procedure can be applied to identify and extract other file types as well. File signatures are also used in Steganography to discern embedded file types within media files</p>
